This is a monorepo with a sample of a design system. Just for study, and to have a nice template of a project.
You have to build all packages before using it.

this is how docs package (storybook) was initialized:
```
# on docs folder
npx sb init --builder vite --type react --use-npm
``` 

This project is deployed with gh-pages, check it [here](https://felipera87.github.io/ignite_design_system/?path=/docs/home--docs)
